This is Grub-0.97 TODO FILE

Before working on anything in this file, it's very important that you
make contact with the core GRUB developers. Things herein might be
slightly out of date or otherwise not easy to understand at first
glance. So write to <bug-grub@gnu.org> first.

Priorities:
  Reported bugs generally have top priority.
  Non-reported and non-encountered bugs (things we know don't work,
    but don't really impede things) have lower priority.
  Things in this file are ranked with one to three !; the more, the
  higher priority.


* Finish the Multiboot Speicification 0.7. !!!

* Add more --disable-FOO options to configure, so that you can create a
  minimum GRUB image. This is useful for boot floppies because of the size
  restriction.

END OF Grub-0.97
